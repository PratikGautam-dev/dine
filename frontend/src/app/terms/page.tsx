                These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern access to and use of DAAP CareConnect
                (&ldquo;CareConnect,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Platform&rdquo;), operated by DaaPrime Tech
                (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;). By using CareConnect — as a hospital, a member of hospital
                staff, a doctor, or a patient booking through WhatsApp — you agree to these Terms. If you do not
                agree, please do not use the Platform.

            <Section id="what-is-careconnect" title="2. What CareConnect is">
              <p>
                CareConnect is a WhatsApp-based appointment booking and reminder platform for hospitals and
                clinics (&ldquo;Hospitals&rdquo;). Patients interact with their Hospital&apos;s own WhatsApp number
                to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments. Hospital staff manage those appointments, patients,
                and doctors through a web dashboard. A hospital admin may optionally connect one Google account for
                the whole hospital to create Google Meet links for tele-consultation appointments.
              </p>
              <p>
                CareConnect is a scheduling and communication tool. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis,
                or treatment, and is not a substitute for professional medical judgment or emergency services. In
                a medical emergency, contact your local emergency services directly.

            <Section id="hospital-accounts" title="3. Hospital accounts">
              <p>
                A Hospital is responsible for the accuracy of the department, doctor, and scheduling information
                it configures on the Platform, for obtaining any consent required from its own patients before
                communicating with them via WhatsApp, and for the conduct of the staff accounts it creates. A
                Hospital must keep its staff login credentials confidential and is responsible for activity under
                its accounts.

            </Section>

            <Section id="patients-whatsapp" title="4. Patients using WhatsApp">
              <p>
                Using CareConnect via WhatsApp is free for patients, though your mobile carrier&apos;s standard
                messaging/data rates may apply, and WhatsApp messaging costs charged by Meta may apply to the
                Hospital. Use of WhatsApp itself is also subject to{" "}

                </a>
                . A patient may withdraw consent to data processing, or request deletion of their data, at any
                time by messaging &ldquo;DELETE&rdquo; to the Hospital&apos;s WhatsApp number.

              <p>
                Connecting a Google account for the Google Meet tele-consultation feature is entirely optional and
                can be disconnected at any time from the hospital admin&apos;s own Settings page. CareConnect only requests
                access to create calendar events, and only ever creates one event per tele-consultation booking —

              <p>
                Fees for a Hospital&apos;s use of CareConnect are as agreed separately between the Hospital and
                DaaPrime Tech. WhatsApp messaging costs charged by Meta to the Hospital are separate from, and in
                addition to, any CareConnect platform fee.

                permitted by law, DaaPrime Tech is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages

                actually paid for the Platform in the preceding three months.

                We may suspend or terminate access to the Platform for a Hospital, staff account, or doctor
                account that violates these Terms. A Hospital may stop using the Platform at any time by
                discontinuing its subscription.
