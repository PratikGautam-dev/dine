# Builds and pushes both CareConnect images to a container registry --
# Option A manual deployment (build locally, push, `docker pull` on the
# VPS), not Coolify's auto-build. Exists so the two-image build+tag+push
# sequence is never typed out by hand (and therefore never half-done or
# mistagged) -- see DEPLOYMENT.md's "Manual image-based deployment" section
# for the full workflow this script is one step of.
#
# Every image gets TWO tags: a version tag (git describe --always --dirty --
# an annotated tag if one exists, otherwise the short commit hash, "-dirty"
# appended if the working tree has uncommitted changes) AND `latest`. The
# version tag is what actually matters for a real deploy -- it's how you
# roll back to a specific build; `latest` is a convenience for
# docker-compose.prod.yml's default and quick manual testing, not a
# promise of what's currently running in production.
#
# Usage:
#   ./docker-publish.sh                          # build + push both images
#   ./docker-publish.sh --no-push                # build + tag only, skip the push (e.g. to test the build)
#   REGISTRY=someotheruser ./docker-publish.sh   # override the default Docker Hub namespace
#
# Required before pushing: `docker login -u daaprime` (Docker Hub -- no
# registry hostname needed, docker.io is the CLI's default) with either your
# Docker Hub password or, better, an Access Token (Docker Hub -> Account
# Settings -> Security -> New Access Token) instead of the real password --
# see DEPLOYMENT.md.
