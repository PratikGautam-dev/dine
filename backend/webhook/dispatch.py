# webhook/dispatch.py
"""
ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md Phase 4: WA-client cache, Redis-backed (with in-memory
fallback) per-message processing lock, and the actual message dispatch into
flows.handle_incoming() -- split out of the former single core/main.py
module. webhook/routes.py's POST /webhook handler calls into this after
parsing/validating the incoming payload; webhook/cron_routes.py's
/internal/send-reminders also reuses _get_whatsapp_client (one client per
hospital, reused for the life of the process).

HISTORY/SESSIONS are the two module-level singletons every webhook/ file
needs -- defined here since this is where message *processing* (not just
receiving) happens, and re-exported for webhook/routes.py to use directly
for its own audio-message/error-notification session lookups.

#
# IMPORTANT — this cache is keyed by hospital.id only, never invalidated, and
# never re-reads the DB once populated: if a hospital's access_token/app_secret
# row is updated directly in the database (e.g. rotating an expired Meta
# token) while this process is already running, that change is NOT picked up
# until the process restarts. A running process will keep using the OLD
# credentials for that hospital indefinitely — sends will keep failing with
# Meta's 401 even after the DB row is fixed — until you restart it. This is
# the single most likely reason a "I already updated the token in the DB"
# report doesn't actually resolve a 401: the fix is a process restart, not a
# second DB update. Verified live (SPEC Section 0's product-readiness pass):
# a same-process re-fetch after a direct DB update still returns the old
# cached client; only a fresh process picks up the new value.
