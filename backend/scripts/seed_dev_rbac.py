"""
Local-dev-only convenience seed for the RBAC rollout (docs/rbac-redis-plan.md)
-- creates a super admin AND a hospital admin with FIXED, known credentials
(printed below) so you can log into both dashboards without going through
onboarding by hand. Unlike scripts/seed_super_admin.py (interactive password
prompt, meant for a real operator account), this is deliberately
non-interactive with a hardcoded test password -- do not run this against a
production database; it exists purely to unblock local testing.

Destructive by design, every run: DELETEs every staff_users and super_admins
row FIRST, then creates fresh ones from the constants below -- so editing
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL/HOSPITAL_ADMIN_EMAIL (or the passwords) in this file and
re-running always takes effect, rather than silently no-op'ing against a
stale row left over from a previous email. role_permissions and the
hospital row itself are NOT touched -- only login identities are reset, not
the tenant or its permission matrix.

If no hospital exists yet, one is created (data_tier="tier1", a throwaway
whatsapp_phone_number_id) so there's somewhere for the admin account to
belong to -- if a hospital already exists, the FIRST one (by id) is reused
instead of creating a second.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.seed_dev_rbac
