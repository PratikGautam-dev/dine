# --- Conversation state (SPEC Section 3.3 state machine) ---
# Same storage mechanism as message history (chat_history.py, Redis with
# in-memory fallback), just a separate key namespace/shape: {"state": str,
# "context": dict, "language": str | None, "updated_at": epoch}.
#
# Keyed by (hospital_id, phone), not phone alone (SPEC Section 12.2 multi-tenant
# routing, Phase 9) — two different hospitals could otherwise collide if the same
# phone number ever messaged both, resuming one hospital's conversation state
# inside another's.
#
# `language` (language-selection follow-up) is deliberately a TOP-LEVEL session
# field, not nested inside `context` -- several state transitions in
# core/booking_flow.py rebuild `context` from scratch rather than spreading the
# old one (e.g. _handle_awaiting_department's `new_context = {"department_id":
# ...}` has no `**context`), so a value nested in `context` would silently get
# dropped partway through a booking. A top-level field, auto-preserved by
# set()/reset() below unless a caller explicitly passes a new one, survives
# every transition without touching every one of those call sites.
#
# reset() deliberately preserves `language` (rather than wiping the whole
# session) when one was already chosen: reset() is called after almost every
# completed action (a booking confirmed, a cancel finished, a reset keyword
# typed) to return to the top-level menu -- wiping language on every one of
# those would re-ask English/Hindi after every single action instead of once
# per genuinely fresh conversation. A session that never had a language
# chosen (or has fully expired past SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS) still resets to
# a clean slate, which is what makes a new/returning-after-a-gap conversation
# get asked again -- "each fresh conversation" per the feature's own intent.
#
# Section 12.13: .get() takes an optional per-call timeout_seconds, since a
# hospital can override the fixed 30-min SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS default
# (hospitals.session_timeout_minutes) -- this ONE store instance is shared
# across every hospital, so the override has to travel with each call rather
# than being fixed at construction time.
#
# get() omits the "language" key entirely when unset (rather than including
# it as None) so every pre-existing `sessions.get(...) == {"state": ...,
# "context": ...}` equality assertion across the test suite keeps working
# unchanged for sessions that never touch language. Every caller reads it via
# `.get("language")`, which returns None either way, so the omission is
# invisible to real code.
