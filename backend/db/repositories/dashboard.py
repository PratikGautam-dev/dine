    """The four "today"-scoped stat tiles (today's appointments, confirmed
    today, new patients today, no-shows today) plus a week-over-week % change
    for each, comparing today against the SAME WEEKDAY exactly 7 days ago --
    picked over a rolling-7-day-average comparison because it's the simplest
    comparison that's still apples-to-apples (a Monday against last Monday,
    not "today" against a blended mix of arbitrary weekdays), and needs only
    a single extra date offset, not a second aggregate shape. Also returns a
    fifth, non-"today"-scoped `upcoming_appointments` count -- see its own
    comment below for why.

    Definitions (all hospital_id + date-scoped):
    - "today's appointments": every appointment (any status) with
      scheduled_at falling on the date in question.
    - "confirmed today": of those, the ones still status='booked' (i.e. not
      cancelled) -- "confirmed" reads most naturally as "still on," not "has
      been formally re-confirmed" (no such action exists in this app).
    - "new patients today": distinct phone numbers whose EARLIEST appointment
      ever at this hospital (by created_at) was created on the date in
      question -- there's no separate patients table, so "new" is derived
      from first-appearance-in-appointments.
    - "no-shows today": still status='booked' appointments whose scheduled_at
      has already passed as of `now` (or, for last week's comparison day,
      the whole day, since it's entirely in the past). KNOWN LIMITATION: this
      app has no "attended"/"completed" status, so this is a heuristic, not a
      true no-show flag -- a booked appointment the patient actually attended
      looks identical to one they skipped once its time has passed. Flagged
      here deliberately rather than silently treated as exact.

    A week-over-week % change with a zero baseline (nothing happened on the
    comparison day) returns None (not a divide-by-zero, not a misleading
    "+100%") -- the caller/template shows "—" for that case.
