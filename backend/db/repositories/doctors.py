    calling it again for a window that's already partly populated (the

    duplicates existing ones. Returns the number of *new* slot rows inserted.

    Section 14.7 additions, all read from the same doctor row:
    - breaks: any candidate slot overlapping a break window (see
      _overlaps_break()) on that day is skipped entirely -- breaks apply
      uniformly to every working day, not a specific one (db/schema.sql's
      comment on doctors.breaks explains why).
    - doctor_leave: any date present there for this doctor is skipped
      entirely, no slots generated for it at all.
    - daily_booking_limit: once a given date would have this many candidate
      slots, generation stops for THAT date (soonest-in-the-day slots first,
      since candidates are already built in ascending time order) -- doesn't
      affect other dates.
    - effective_from: dates before it are skipped -- update_doctor() only
      deletes existing slots on/after this date (see its own docstring), so
      generating for earlier dates here would incorrectly add new-pattern
      slots alongside still-standing old-pattern ones.

    conn is an optional explicit connection (rather than get_connection())
    because db/seed.py calls this against a connection it's still assembling,
    before db.connection's shared connection has been repointed to it.

    Deliberately NOT migrated to get_session()/ORM along with the rest of
    this file: that conn override is exactly what makes db/seed.py's
    bootstrap-time call correct (a fresh, not-yet-global raw connection,
    per that file's own comment) -- get_session() has no equivalent notion
    of "a session bound to a connection that isn't the global one yet", and
    bridging a raw psycopg2 connection into a SQLAlchemy engine/session
    isn't worth the risk for a function this correctness-critical (it
    directly determines booking availability). create_doctor()/
    update_doctor() above call this WITHOUT conn=, so it falls back to its
    own get_connection() -- safe because both that raw connection and the
    ORM session's engine run in Postgres autocommit, so a write already
    committed by one is immediately visible to a read from the other, same
