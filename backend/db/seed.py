# db/seed.py
"""
Seed data. Two kinds:

- seed_default_hospital(): the one real hospital this build actually serves,
  carried over verbatim from the old mock_data.py's DEPARTMENTS/DOCTORS_BY_DEPARTMENT.
  Real per-hospital department/doctor rows come from Phase 3's ERP wiring or the
  Section 12.1 onboarding wizard; this is the Tier 1 stand-in for that.

- seed_test_hospital(): a second, entirely fake hospital used ONLY by
  tests/conftest.py to prove multi-tenant isolation (SPEC Section 12.2/Phase 9)
  — never called from init_db_on_connection, so it never exists in a real
  deployment's database.

Every seeded doctor gets the same working pattern (all 7 days, 10:00-11:00 and
15:00-16:00, 60-minute slots -- exactly the old hardcoded _SLOT_TIMES) so
db.repository.get_slots() keeps returning the same "10:00"/"15:00" slots
existing tests already expect, now sourced from real generated doctor_slots
rows (Section 12.1.1) instead of computed on the fly.
