"""google_calendar_connections: Google Meet integration for tele-consultation
appointments, alongside (not replacing) the existing Jitsi link

Revision ID: 0027
Revises: 0026
Create Date: 2026-09-03

Renumbered twice now, same root cause both times: concurrent branches each
forking a new migration off the same parent. First 0022 -> 0025 (collided
with patient_documents.document_type/appointment-type relabel v2/
followup_override_until, all forked from 0021). Then, merging dev into
chandan-dev, this 0025 collided again with the Lab Test branch's own new
0025 (diagnostic_tests_and_resources) and 0026 (lab_test_basket_and_
collection), both also forked from 0024 -- so this one moves to 0027, after
both. Never applied to production either time, so renumbering is safe.

Approved plan (confirmed with the user): a doctor can optionally connect
their own Google account (a SEPARATE OAuth client from GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/
SECRET's hospital-owner sign-in flow, its own scope -- calendar.events only)
so a tele-consultation booking creates a real Google Calendar event with a
Meet link instead of a Jitsi room. One row per doctor (1:1, doctor_id is both
PK and FK) -- a row's mere existence means "connected"; no lazy blank row.

Deliberately additive and fully backward-compatible: no doctor has a row
here until they explicitly connect (nobody will, until the real
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/CALENDAR_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY env vars are
set in the deployment -- see core/config.py), so
flows/booking/types/tele_consultation.py's fallback-to-Jitsi path is the
only path exercised until then, unchanged.

access_token/refresh_token are stored Fernet-encrypted (core/crypto.py),
never raw -- see db/orm_models.py::GoogleCalendarConnection's own docstring.
