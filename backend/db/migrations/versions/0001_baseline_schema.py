"""baseline schema snapshot

Revision ID: 0001
Revises:
Create Date: 2026-08-27

Captures db/schema.sql byte-for-byte, frozen at the moment Alembic was
adopted -- this is what makes it a *baseline*, not a live mirror: db/schema.sql
is still read by db/init_db.py today (unchanged in this migration), and this
revision's SQL will NOT be updated if schema.sql changes later. Every future
schema change becomes its own new Alembic revision instead.

Safe to run against an already-migrated production database: every statement
below is IF NOT EXISTS / IF EXISTS-guarded (schema.sql's own long-standing
"safe to re-run" convention -- see its own header comment), so replaying it
is a no-op there. On a brand-new database it produces the exact schema
db/init_db.py's `conn.executescript(schema_sql)` path already produces.

No downgrade: this is a snapshot of everything that existed before Alembic
was adopted, not one incremental step -- there is no well-defined "previous
state" to revert to.

-- db/schema.sql
-- SPEC Section 4 data model. Postgres (Neon), per Section 6/12.6 -- migrated
-- off SQLite before real production load; db/repository.py is the only module
-- that knows this is Postgres (via db/connection.py), and even it barely
-- changed: datetimes are still stored as ISO-8601 TEXT (written by Python's
-- .isoformat(), read back with datetime.fromisoformat()) exactly as they were
-- under SQLite, since Postgres's TEXT type and lexical ISO-8601 string
-- ordering behave identically for our purposes -- there was no need to
-- retype those columns as TIMESTAMP to get a correct migration. hospital_id
-- is on every table from day one per Section 4/12.2, even now that only one
-- real hospital exists — the point is to never have to retrofit this column
-- onto live data later.
--
-- Safe to re-run: every statement is IF NOT EXISTS (Postgres supports this
-- for CREATE TABLE/CREATE INDEX the same as SQLite did).
