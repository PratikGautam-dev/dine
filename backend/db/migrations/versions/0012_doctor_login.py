"""doctors.email / password_hash -- dedicated doctor login

Revision ID: 0012
Revises: 0011
Create Date: 2026-08-29

Additive, nullable columns supporting a new, separate doctor-login auth
path (auth/doctor_session.py, portal/routes/doctor_auth.py,
portal/routes/doctor_portal.py) -- issued/reset by an admin through the
existing shared staff portal (POST /api/portal/doctors/{doctor_id}/login-credentials),
never self-registered. Nullable by design: an existing doctor row with
email IS NULL simply has no login yet, and every doctor-management/booking
path that already reads `doctors` keeps working completely unchanged --
this is additive on top of the shared staff portal, not a replacement for
it.

password_hash uses the exact same PBKDF2-SHA256 scheme as
hospitals.portal_password_hash (db/repositories/hospitals.py's
hash_portal_password()/verify_portal_password()) -- reused as-is for
doctors rather than inventing a second hashing scheme.
