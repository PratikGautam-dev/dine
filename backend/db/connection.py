# db/connection.py
"""
Thin connection layer — the only place that knows this is Postgres (SPEC
Section 6/12.6: moved off SQLite before real production load, onto Neon).
Swapping the backend again later means changing this file and db/schema.sql,
not touching db/repository.py's callers (core/booking_flow.py,
reminders/scheduler.py, slots/scheduler.py) — those only ever call
get_connection() and use the connection's .execute()/.commit() methods.

_PGConnection below is a thin adapter, not a different database abstraction:
it exists purely so db/repository.py's existing conn.execute(sql, params)
.fetchone()/.fetchall() call sites (written against sqlite3.Connection's
chainable-cursor convenience method) keep working unchanged against psycopg2,
which has no such method on the connection object itself. It also rewrites
the `?` placeholders repository.py already uses into psycopg2's `%s` style,
so that conversion didn't have to touch every call site individually.

psycopg2 (sync) was chosen over asyncpg specifically because every
db/repository.py function is already plain sync code called directly from
async FastAPI handlers (blocking the event loop each call, same as the old
sqlite3 driver did) — switching to asyncpg would mean async-ifying every
repository function and every caller, a far bigger change than "swap the
database backend."

A single module-level connection is reused for the process lifetime. Neon
(serverless Postgres) closes idle connections server-side after a period of
inactivity, so _PGConnection transparently detects and reconnects around
that (see execute()/_ensure_connected() below) rather than the app crashing
on the next query after a quiet spell. Tests swap it out via set_connection()
to point at a real (testcontainers-provisioned) Postgres instance whose
schema gets reset between tests — see tests/conftest.py.

Recommendation (not implemented here): a single persistent connection is
adequate for this app's current traffic and is what the detect-and-reconnect
fix below targets, but it's a stopgap, not the ideal end state for a
serverless-Postgres backend. Neon's own pooled connection string (the
"-pooler" host, already what most Neon connection strings default to) or a
proper client-side pool (psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool, or an
external pgbouncer) would avoid single-point-of-failure reconnect latency
entirely and handle concurrent requests better once traffic grows beyond
what one connection can serialize through. Worth revisiting before this
app has enough concurrent load that connection-per-request contention (or
this module's reconnect-on-failure retry) becomes a bottleneck.
