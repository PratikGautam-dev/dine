"""
ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md Phase 4: the composition root -- FastAPI app
construction, middleware, lifespan, and include_router calls only. Split
out of the former single core/main.py module, which mixed this with
webhook routing, the WA-client cache, and message locking (now
webhook/routes.py, webhook/dispatch.py, webhook/cron_routes.py).

Deployment note: the ASGI app is now `main:app`, not `core.main:app` -- see
ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md's Phase A/Phase 4 status notes for what else that
touches (Dockerfile CMD, railway.toml startCommand).

    """db/connection.py's get_session() returns ONE SQLAlchemy Session
    reused for the process lifetime (by design, mirrors get_connection()'s
    single reused raw connection) -- isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT" on the
    underlying engine keeps a failed statement from poisoning Postgres's
    own transaction state, but the ORM Session ALSO tracks its own
    in_transaction() bookkeeping, independent of that, and nothing anywhere
    else ever called session.rollback() to clear it after a request-level
    exception. Left alone, the first ORM statement to fail on ANY request
    (a bad query, a constraint violation, a stale column) leaves the SAME
    shared session stuck for every request afterward -- including ones with
    nothing to do with whatever failed originally -- raising
    sqlalchemy.exc.PendingRollbackError until the process restarts.

    Production incident: a plain .rollback() isn't enough for the OTHER way
    this session gets stuck -- Neon (serverless Postgres) closing the
    underlying connection server-side after a period of inactivity
    ("SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly", sqlalchemy.exc.
    OperationalError). pool_pre_ping=True on the engine can't catch this,
    because this Session never returns its connection to the pool between
    requests (get_session() hands back the SAME Session/connection for the
    process lifetime) -- pre_ping only re-validates a connection AT
    CHECKOUT, which happens exactly once here. .rollback() on an already-
    dead connection just fails silently (caught below) and leaves that same
    dead connection wired in for every request after it, forever, until the
    whole process restarts. reset_session() (db/connection.py) is the real
    fix for that case: it discards the Session outright, so the NEXT
    get_session() call builds a fresh one bound to a fresh pool checkout
    (where pre_ping DOES get to run). Using it here unconditionally instead
    of a plain rollback() is a strict superset -- it also clears the
    poisoned-transaction case above, just via a fresh Session instead of a
    rolled-back one, at the negligible cost of one extra connection
    checkout on the next request."""
