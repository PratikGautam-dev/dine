# flows/patient_identity/__init__.py
"""Patient identity resolution: WhatsApp Account != Patient. One phone can be
linked to several patient profiles (family members), so this package figures
out WHICH patient the current conversation is acting on before anything else
runs -- registration for a first-time phone, duplicate-patient detection,
switching between already-linked patients, and the Main Menu itself (with
its "Patient: X / Patient Code: Y" header).

flows/router.py's `_enter_idle()` calls `get_or_prompt_for_active_patient()`
right after language is settled, before the main menu is shown, for every
conversation -- everything after the main menu (flows/booking/, faq.py)
trusts an already-resolved `active_patient_id` instead of re-deriving
identity itself.

Architectural boundary: never import db/repository.py directly, only through
connectors.py -- every hospital-scoped read/write goes through the
`Connector` interface passed into each function here.

Physically split (same motivation/shape as flows/booking/'s own package) into:

  state.py             STATE_* constants, row/button ids, pure parsing
                        helpers (age/name/contact-number)
  menu.py               the unified main menu + patient header
  registration.py       [Myself/Someone Else] -> name -> [contact number] ->
                        age -> gender -> [duplicate decision] -> create/link
  resolution.py          the "which patient is this" entry point --
                        already-resolved fast path, single-patient
                        confirmation, 2+-patient selector
  manage_patients.py    Remove Patient / Add Patient 2-option screen
  consent.py            Consent & Privacy menu item
  dispatch.py            _HANDLERS -- state -> handler, for flows/router.py's
                        generic dispatch

This module re-exports the combined public (and historically
underscore-prefixed private, still relied on by tests/flows/router.py)
surface so every existing `import flows.patient_identity as patient_identity`
/ `from flows.patient_identity import X` call site keeps working exactly as
before this split -- same convention flows/booking/__init__.py already
established.

Known scope note: flows/booking/book.py still has its own older, dead-for-
real-traffic patient-selector/Manage-Patients implementation, kept only
because tests/test_booking_flow.py exercises it directly as a standalone
state machine test.
