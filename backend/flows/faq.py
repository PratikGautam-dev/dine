# faq_flow.py
"""
SPEC Section 14.5 (originally 14.2, under the single-flow_type model that
Section 14.5 replaced): the FAQ sub-flow. A hospital that enables the "faq"
feature (hospitals.enabled_features) gets a "FAQ / Information" row in the
unified main menu (flows.py); tapping it hands the conversation here for as
long as the patient keeps tapping topics.

Deliberately shallow: no state machine depth beyond one level (unlike
booking's department -> doctor -> slot -> confirm chain, Section 3.3) --
every incoming message while active (a topic tap, unrecognized free text)
shows the topic list; tapping a topic replies with that topic's configured
answer, then loops straight back to the topic list. The one bit of state that
DOES exist, STATE_FAQ_ACTIVE, exists purely so flows.py's router knows to
keep delegating subsequent messages here instead of falling back to the
unified main menu after every single message -- Section 14.2's original
version reset to true IDLE after every message, which was fine when FAQ was
its own exclusive top-level flow_type, but would have meant "tap a topic,
then anything else you send goes to the unified menu instead of the topic
list" once FAQ became one feature among several. A reset keyword (Section 0's
"stuck session" fix, via core/flow_common.py's is_reset_keyword()) is handled
by flows.py's router BEFORE it ever delegates here, so it always returns to
the top-level unified menu, not just this flow's own topic list -- this
module still needs no dedicated reset-keyword check of its own.

`connector` is accepted only to match the shared sub-flow call signature
flows.py delegates with -- FAQ flow does not use Section 12.6.2's connector
interface at all (no bookings, no Tier 1/2/3 relevance).

Reuses core/flow_common.py's cap_rows() (Meta's 10-row WhatsApp list limit,
Section 12.7's finding) rather than reimplementing it -- that bug was found
and fixed once already, in booking_flow.py; a second flow type is exactly
the case that extraction was for.

Section 12.11 (language selection): `language` is threaded through from
flows.py's router the same way every other sub-flow now takes it -- only the
bot's own fixed strings ("choose a topic", "View Topics", ...) are looked up
via core/translations.t(); a topic's configured answer_text is hospital-
entered content and is never auto-translated (same rule as everywhere else
in this feature).
