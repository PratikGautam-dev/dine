    department selection using it, bypassing every branch below entirely --
    this module no longer owns patient resolution for real traffic. Left
    None (every existing call site/test), the full 0/1/2+ resolution below
    runs exactly as before -- see the "known scope decision" in
    core/patient_identity.py's own module docstring for why this module's
    own selector logic below is kept rather than deleted.

    Patient identity/UX follow-up (Spec.md Section 0): name/age collection
    moved to the FRONT of the booking flow -- asked immediately after "Book
    Appointment" is tapped, before department selection -- instead of the
    back (after date/time selection, Section 12.11's original placement,
    kept unchanged through Sections 12.12/12.13). Confirmed with the user
    directly (not assumed) before making this change.

    Patient identity SEPARATION (Spec.md Section 0), superseding the
    immediately-prior "ask name every time" behavior (confirmed with the
    user this was a workaround for having no real profile concept yet, now
    replaced): a phone with ZERO linked patients is asked for a name (the
    implicit first/"Self" profile, mirroring the migration backfill's own
    convention); a phone with exactly ONE linked patient auto-selects it and
    proceeds straight to department selection, zero added friction -- the
    same single-patient UX this app has always had; a phone with MORE THAN
    ONE linked patient sees STATE_AWAITING_PATIENT_SELECTION first. Name/age
    is never re-asked for an already-linked patient -- it's captured once,
    at profile creation, then just selected.

    Shared by flows.py's real dispatch (_start_feature) AND this module's
    own standalone _handle_idle() below (superseded for real traffic, but
    still exercised directly by tests/test_booking_flow.py as a standalone
