"""Maps an `appointment_types.id` to its `TypeFlow` -- the one place
book.py/messages.py look up which shared steps a given type's booking goes
through. A hospital-custom type id not in this built-in catalog falls back
to FULL_FLOW (today's original pipeline) rather than crashing -- an
unrecognized type gets the safe, fully-generic flow until it's given its own
module here."""
