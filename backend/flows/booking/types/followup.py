# flows/booking/types/followup.py
"""Follow-up: shows every department's most recent ATTENDED appointment
still within the hospital's eligibility window (hospital_settings.
followup_validity_days, docs/per-appointment-type-flow-plan.md Phase 2 Step
2 follow-up), lets the patient pick one, then skips department/doctor
selection entirely and jumps straight to date selection -- floored to
strictly after that previous visit's own date, since a follow-up can't
predate the visit it follows. Confirmation and success then show Follow-up's
own card text (build_confirmation_summary/build_success_summary hooks), not
the generic cards every other type shares; the Confirm/Cancel/Back and
Reschedule/Cancel/Main-Menu buttons underneath are unchanged either way.

messages.py imports are lazy (inside functions) to avoid a circular import:
this module -> types.registry -> this module."""
