Shared helpers used by every flow_type handler module (SPEC Section 14.1) --
core/booking_flow.py and faq_flow.py both import from here rather than each
reimplementing the same fixes. Extracted out of core/booking_flow.py
specifically because Section 14's second flow type (FAQ) is exactly the case
this was for: a fix made once, in one flow, needs to actually apply to every
flow, not just the one it happened to be found in first.

# working-hour range and a short slot duration can easily generate 100+
# bookable slots (Section 12.1.1), and an unenforced-limit send silently fails
# end to end -- send_list() catches the resulting 400 from Meta, logs it, and
# returns without raising, so the patient just sees nothing, with no error
# surfaced anywhere they'd see it. cap_rows() is the one place this gets
# enforced, applied at every send_list() call site that builds its rows from
# a variable-length source (departments/doctors/slots/appointments/FAQ topics).
