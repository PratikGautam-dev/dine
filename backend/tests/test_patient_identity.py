# tests/test_patient_identity.py
"""
Patient identity system (Spec.md Section 0): two permanent, human-readable
ids generated ONCE per patient, together, sharing the same per-(hospital,
year) sequence number (db/display_ids.py's shared code_sequences table) --
patient_display_id (DCCP-<year>-<sequential number>, e.g. DCCP-2026-00001,
portal-facing) and mrn (MRN-<hospital short code>-<year>-<sequential
number>, e.g. MRN-DEF-2026-00001, the clinical/legal record number) --
assigned at the moment a `patients` row is first created for a
(hospital_id, phone) pair, never regenerated on a later booking.

Covers:
  - sequential + hospital-scoped generation (two hospitals both start at
    0001 independently)
  - never regenerated on a second booking by the same patient
  - the one-time backfill assigns ids to pre-existing patients in creation
    order, no duplicates/gaps, and is idempotent
  - the hospital short code is derived once from the hospital's own name and
    stored permanently (not recomputed on a later lookup) -- visible in mrn,
    not patient_display_id, which is hospital-agnostic-looking on purpose
