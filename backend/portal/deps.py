    RBAC (docs/rbac-redis-plan.md): the vast majority of portal/routes/*.py
    files (settings, patients, dashboard, doctors, appointment_types,
    daycare_duration_options, documents, bookings, handoffs) were written
    against ONLY this function, before staff_users/JWTs existed, and every
    one of them just needs a Hospital -- none of them call
    require_permission(), only (some of them) require_capability(), which is
    the orthogonal tenant-level gate and is untouched by any of this. Rather
    than touching every one of those route files to also try
    get_current_staff(), this function itself now accepts EITHER token: the
    legacy shared-hospital-password session (_verify_session, tried first
    since it's cheaper -- no DB round trip) OR a staff JWT (verify_access_token),
    resolved to that staff member's hospital. This is what makes logging in
    through the NEW unified staff login work on every existing route
    immediately, not just the handful (doctor_portal.py, staff_auth.py,
    roles.py, staff.py) written against get_current_staff() directly.

    Deliberately loses role/doctor_id granularity here -- a staff JWT
    authenticated through this path is only ever a Hospital, same as the old
    shared-password token always was, so a receptionist or doctor logging in
    still gets whatever these NOT-yet-permission-gated routes always granted
    every authenticated caller. That's an accepted gap for this rollout
    phase (docs/rbac-redis-plan.md's Phase 6 cleanup is what tightens these
    routes to require_permission() one at a time), not a regression -- it's
    exactly the access level the legacy shared password already gave
