# portal/permissions.py
"""
Per-role, per-page view/write/delete permissions (docs/rbac-redis-plan.md) --
the direct sibling of portal/capabilities.py, same fixed-set-+-membership-
tests shape, just one level more granular: capabilities.py gates whole
PAGES/features on for a TENANT (hospital vs. clinic); this module gates
individual ACTIONS on those pages for a ROLE within one tenant (Admin can
delete a patient, Receptionist can only view/write, Doctor can't see
Settings at all). The two are orthogonal and both apply -- a clinic tenant
without MANAGE_DOCTORS capability shows no Doctors nav item to ANY role
regardless of what role_permissions says, since capabilities.py's gate runs
first, at the tenant level.

Permissions are per-ROLE only (locked in with the user, docs/rbac-redis-plan.md's
own "Decisions locked in" section) -- not per-individual overrides. Every
Admin at a hospital has identical permissions to every other Admin there;
editing "Admin" changes it for every admin at that hospital at once. This is
what makes ONE row per (hospital, role, page) (db/schema.sql's
role_permissions table) sufficient, rather than needing a row per staff
member.
