"""
Tenant-type-driven capability gating (tenant-capability-gating-plan.md).

Every tenant is a row in `hospitals` -- there's no separate tenant table.
Today every authenticated staff-portal session gets full access to every
route; the business need is a reduced admin surface for `tenant_type =
'clinic'` rows (no doctor/department management) without scattering
`if tenant_type == "clinic"` conditionals through route code. This module is
the single source of truth both the default-by-type resolution and every
route's own capability check go through -- mirrors `flows.patient_identity`'s
`_FEATURE_MENU`/`REAL_FEATURES` pattern almost exactly (a fixed set +
membership tests), just for staff/admin capabilities instead of the
patient-facing WhatsApp menu. Deliberately a SEPARATE concept from
`hospitals.enabled_features` (which controls the WhatsApp menu, not this
staff-portal surface) -- the two must never be conflated.
