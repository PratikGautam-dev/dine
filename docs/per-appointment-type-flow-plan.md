# Per-appointment-type booking flow (Phase 1: structure, Phase 2: behavior)

## Context

Appointment type selection already exists (`appointment_types` table, `STATE_AWAITING_APPOINTMENT_TYPE`,
7 default types: new, followup, tele, second_opinion, diagnostic, lab, daycare — each with
`requires_consent`/`requires_doctor_selection` flags). But after the user picks a type, every type
funnels through the *identical* hardcoded pipeline: department → doctor → date → time-slot →
confirm → (consent) → create. `requires_doctor_selection` is stored and seeded but never read
anywhere in `flows/booking/*.py` — confirmed via `grep -rn "requires_doctor_selection"`, only
hits are DB/repo/seed code and one test fixture. So diagnostic/lab still force a department+doctor
pick today even though nothing about them needs one.

This isn't sustainable: as more type-specific rules get added (daycare date-ranges, tele video
links, lab test selection, etc.), that logic would have to get jammed into the same shared
handler functions as more and more `if appointment_type_id == "..."` branches, making
`flows/booking/book.py` unreadable. The user wants each type's flow kept **separately** so the
code structure mirrors the business concept — while still not duplicating the shared mechanics
(patient resolution, confirmation, consent gate, resource-locked creation) that every type
actually shares.

**Confirmed with user**: this pass is Phase 1 — pure restructuring — with one concrete Phase-1
behavior change: diagnostic/lab skip department AND doctor selection entirely, going straight
from appointment-type selection to date/time-slot. Every other type (new, followup, tele,
second_opinion, daycare) keeps today's exact department→doctor→date→slot→confirm(→consent)
sequence, unchanged, in this pass. Phase 2 (later, separate pass) is where further per-type
divergence lands (e.g. daycare date-range instead of single slot, tele video-link generation,
lab/diagnostic test-selection step) — the structure built in Phase 1 is what makes Phase 2 additions
land as new files instead of new branches in shared code.

## Design: per-type "step list" strategy, not per-type flow duplication

Rather than writing 7 fully separate state machines (duplicating the department/doctor/date/slot
handler bodies 7 times), each appointment type gets an ordered **step list** — the sequence of
shared states it passes through — and the existing generic handlers (department picker, doctor
picker, date picker, slot picker — unchanged bodies) become step-list-driven instead of
hardcoded-next-state. This is the standard way to give each type "its own flow" for readability
and future divergence, without duplicating mechanics that are genuinely identical today.

### New package: `backend/flows/booking/types/`

- **`base.py`** — `TypeFlow` dataclass: `type_id: str`, `steps: tuple[str, ...]` (ordered
  subset of `STATE_AWAITING_DEPARTMENT` / `_DOCTOR` / `_DATE` / `_TIME_SLOT` /
  `STATE_AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`, always ending in `STATE_AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`). Methods:
  `first_step()`, `next_step(current) -> str | None`, `prev_step(current) -> str | None`
  (walks the tuple; "before first step" resolves back to `STATE_AWAITING_APPOINTMENT_TYPE`).
- **Two shared step-list constants** (in `base.py`, reused by multiple type modules —
  not duplicated per file):
  ```python
  FULL_FLOW = (STATE_AWAITING_DEPARTMENT, STATE_AWAITING_DOCTOR, STATE_AWAITING_DATE,
               STATE_AWAITING_TIME_SLOT, STATE_AWAITING_CONFIRMATION)
  NO_DOCTOR_FLOW = (STATE_AWAITING_DATE, STATE_AWAITING_TIME_SLOT, STATE_AWAITING_CONFIRMATION)
  ```
- **One small module per type** (this is the literal "keep type flow separate" ask — each file
  is where that type's future custom behavior will live, even though today most just declare
  which shared step list they use):
  - `new_consultation.py`, `followup.py`, `tele_consultation.py`, `second_opinion.py`,
    `daycare.py` → each: `FLOW = TypeFlow(type_id="...", steps=FULL_FLOW)`.
  - `diagnostic.py`, `lab.py` → each: `FLOW = TypeFlow(type_id="...", steps=NO_DOCTOR_FLOW)`
    — this is the one real Phase-1 behavior change.
- **`registry.py`** — `TYPE_FLOWS: dict[str, TypeFlow]` built from the modules above;
  `get_type_flow(appointment_type_id: str) -> TypeFlow` returns the match or a `FULL_FLOW`
  default for any hospital-custom type id not in the built-in catalog (so a hospital adding a
  novel type later doesn't crash the flow — it just gets the full generic pipeline until someone
  gives it its own module).

### Changes to existing files (mechanics stay generic, only *transitions* become data-driven)

- **`flows/booking/book.py`**:
  - `_handle_awaiting_appointment_type`: after storing `appointment_type_id` in context, replace
    the hardcoded `→ STATE_AWAITING_DEPARTMENT` transition with
    `get_type_flow(appointment_type_id).first_step()`.
  - Department/doctor/date/time-slot completion branches: replace each hardcoded "next state"
    constant with `get_type_flow(context["appointment_type_id"]).next_step(current_state)`.
  - Back-navigation (`_CHANGE_TARGETS`, and wherever `_history_pop_to`/`_find_by_id` walk
    backwards) uses `flow.prev_step(current_state)` instead of the static dict, so diagnostic/lab
    back-navigate from DATE straight to APPOINTMENT_TYPE (no department/doctor to return to).
  - `_handle_awaiting_confirmation`'s existing consent gate
    (`if context.get("appointment_type_requires_consent"): → STATE_AWAITING_CONSENT`) is
    untouched — consent stays a DB-driven flag orthogonal to the step-list, not part of `steps`.
- **`flows/booking/messages.py`**: the "Change ..." selection menu (`_send_change_selection` /
  equivalent) builds its options from `flow.steps` instead of a fixed list, so diagnostic/lab
  only ever show "Change Date" / "Change Time", never "Change Department" / "Change Doctor".
- **`flows/booking/state.py`**: no new states needed — `STATE_AWAITING_DEPARTMENT`/`_DOCTOR` are
  simply absent from `NO_DOCTOR_FLOW`'s step tuple, so their handlers are never entered for
  diagnostic/lab; their handler bodies stay completely unchanged.

### Why this shape (not per-type duplicated handlers)

- Department/doctor/date/slot picking logic is identical across every type today — duplicating
  those handler bodies into 7 files would be exactly the kind of premature/duplicated code the
  user doesn't want. The step-list keeps mechanics in one place, while giving each type its own
  file as the natural home for whatever *does* diverge (now: which steps to include; later:
  type-specific extra steps/handlers).
- Adding a genuinely new step for one type later (Phase 2 — e.g. a "select test" step for
  `lab.py`) is then a two-line change: add a new state to that type's `steps` tuple, add its
  handler to the shared dispatch dict, done — no other type's file or the shared handlers need
  to change.

## Phase 2 — per-type behavior, one type at a time (confirmed with the user: implement and land
one type at a time, waiting for confirmation before moving to the next)

### Step 1 — New Consultation (`new_consultation.py`) — ✅ DONE

Two New-Consultation-only booking rules, confirmed with the user:
1. A patient cannot have a second ACTIVE (non-cancelled) booking in the SAME department — must
   cancel the existing one first. Enforced right when the department is picked (doesn't need a
   date), so the patient sees the conflict immediately instead of after picking doctor/date/slot.
2. A patient cannot book a DIFFERENT department on a day they already have ANY active booking —
   one active booking per day, regardless of department. Enforced right before the booking is
   actually created, since it needs the chosen date.

**How it was built** — two `TypeFlow` hooks (`flows/booking/types/base.py`):
- `validate_department`: an optional `(connector, hospital_id, patient_id, department_id) -> str | None`
  callable, checked in `book.py`'s `_handle_awaiting_department` right after a department is
  selected (before the doctor menu is even sent). On a conflict, sends the translated message as
  plain text and re-shows the department menu (session stays at `AWAITING_DEPARTMENT`).
- `validate_booking`: an optional `(connector, hospital_id, patient_id, department_id, scheduled_at) -> str | None`
  callable, `None` by default for every type that has nothing extra to check. This is the general
  Phase 2 extension point every subsequent step below plugs into the same way.
- `db/repositories/appointments.py` — new `get_active_appointments_for_patient(hospital_id, patient_id)`
  (STATUS_BOOKED only, scoped by `patient_id` not `phone`, since one phone can have several linked
  patients), exposed through `Connector`/`Tier1Connector`.
- `flows/booking/types/new_consultation.py` — `_validate_new_consultation_department(...)` (rule 1,
  wired to `validate_department`) and `_validate_new_consultation_booking(...)` (both rules, wired
  to `validate_booking` as a same-department safety net plus the same-day check), both against
  `get_active_appointments_for_patient`.
- `flows/booking/book.py` — `_handle_awaiting_department` calls `flow.validate_department(...)`
  right after department selection; `_create_booking_and_notify` calls `flow.validate_booking(...)`
  right after `_reject_if_patient_link_invalid` and before `connector.create_booking(...)` (context
  can still change up to that exact point via "change selection," so a same-department re-check
  here too, not just at department-selection time).
- `core/translations.py` — `new_consultation_department_conflict` / `new_consultation_same_day_conflict`
  (en/hi).

### Step 2 — Follow-up (`followup.py`) — ✅ DONE

Confirmed with the user: picking Follow-up shows every department's most recent **ATTENDED**
appointment still within the hospital's own configurable eligibility window (not just any past
booking — a no-show or a still-upcoming booking doesn't count, and an attended visit stops being
eligible once it ages past the window). No eligible consultation at all (never attended anywhere,
or every attended visit has expired) → told, sent back to appointment-type selection. Picking one
auto-selects that department/doctor and skips straight to date selection — floored to strictly
after that previous visit's own date, so a follow-up can never be booked for a date at or before
the visit it follows. Confirmation and success then use Follow-up's own card text (Patient ID,
Previous Visit, an optional Follow-up Fee line), not the generic cards every other type shares.
Every screen has a Back button, matching the existing convention everywhere else in the flow.

**Per-hospital settings, not more `hospitals` columns** — a new `hospital_settings` table
(`db/repositories/hospital_settings.py`, migration `0021_followup_eligibility_and_fees`), 1:1 with
`hospitals`, created lazily on first read/write: `followup_validity_days` (NULL → 30-day code
default), `followup_fee`, `new_consultation_fee` (stored now, not displayed anywhere yet —
confirmed with the user; New Consultation's own cards keep their existing static-then-real fee
line unrelated to this table). Portal-editable via `/api/portal/settings` and a new "Follow-up
appointments" section on the settings page (`frontend/src/app/portal/settings/page.tsx`).

**How it was built**:
- `db/repositories/appointments.py` — new `get_followup_eligible_appointments(hospital_id,
  patient_id, validity_days)`: most recent STATUS_ATTENDED appointment per department, only if
  still within `validity_days` of its own `scheduled_at` (dedup done in Python, not a SQL window
  function — one patient's attended history is always a small list). Exposed through
  `Connector`/`Tier1Connector`.
- `flows/booking/state.py` — `STATE_AWAITING_FOLLOWUP_SELECTION` (the eligible-list step) replaces
  the earlier single-visit auto-select + confirm-before-date screen (`STATE_AWAITING_FOLLOWUP_CONFIRM`,
  now removed).
- `flows/booking/types/followup.py` — `_on_followup_selected` (the `on_selected` hook) fetches the
  eligible list and either shows it (one row per department, `_appointment_row_id`/
  `_parse_appointment_row_id` reused from the existing appointment-selection convention) or shows
  the "no eligible consultation" screen. Its own state handler
  (`_handle_awaiting_followup_selection`) resolves the tapped row back to a fresh eligibility
  re-query (never trusts a stashed list — eligibility can genuinely change mid-conversation),
  fills department/doctor/previous-visit-date into context, and jumps straight to
  `STATE_AWAITING_DATE` with the new `min_date` floor. `steps=NO_DOCTOR_FLOW` (not `FULL_FLOW`) so
  shared bookkeeping (the change-selection menu) correctly hides "Change Department"/"Change
  Doctor" here too, same as diagnostic/lab.
- `flows/booking/messages.py` — `_send_date_menu` gained an optional `min_date` parameter (dates
  strictly after this "YYYY-MM-DD" string are kept; `None` for every other type is a no-op).
  `_send_confirmation` checks a new `TypeFlow.build_confirmation_summary` hook first, using
  Follow-up's own card text when set instead of the generic `CONFIRM_BOOKING_SUMMARY` (Confirm/
  Cancel/Back buttons unchanged either way). `_resend_menu_for_state` gained a case for
  `STATE_AWAITING_FOLLOWUP_SELECTION` (lazy re-fetches and resends the eligible list) and passes
  the stashed `min_date` through on a `STATE_AWAITING_DATE` resend too.
- `flows/booking/book.py` — `_create_booking_and_notify` checks a new `TypeFlow.build_success_summary`
  hook, using Follow-up's own success text instead of the generic `BOOKING_CONFIRMED` (the
  Reschedule/Cancel/Main-Menu buttons underneath are unaffected either way). The date-emptied-out
  retry branch in `_handle_awaiting_time_slot` also passes `min_date` through.
- `flows/booking/types/base.py` — two new optional `TypeFlow` hooks: `build_confirmation_summary`
  `(context, hospital_id) -> str` and `build_success_summary` `(appointment, context, hospital_id)
  -> str`. `None` (every type but Follow-up) means the generic templates are used as-is.
- `flows/booking/dispatch.py` — registers `STATE_AWAITING_FOLLOWUP_SELECTION`'s handler in the
  shared `_HANDLERS` dict.
- `core/translations/booking.py` — `no_previous_appointment_for_followup`,
  `followup_eligible_list_prompt`, `view_followup_options_button`, `followup_eligible_section_title`,
  `followup_confirmation_summary`, `followup_appointment_confirmed` (en/hi); `followup_confirm_prompt`
  removed (superseded by the eligible-list flow).
- Tests: `tests/test_booking_flow.py`'s
  `test_followup_eligible_list_then_selecting_one_goes_straight_to_date_selection`,
  `test_followup_back_from_date_returns_to_eligible_list`,
  `test_followup_with_no_previous_visit_sends_back_to_appointment_type` (rewritten for the new
  flow); `tests/test_hospital_settings.py`'s new Follow-up fee tests; `tests/test_portal_api.py`'s
  new settings tests for `followup_validity_days`/`followup_fee`/`new_consultation_fee`.
- Full backend suite passing except the same pre-existing, unrelated reception-handoff and
  patient-gender-step failures (both predate and are unrelated to this work).

### Step 3 — Tele Consultation (`tele_consultation.py`) — ✅ DONE

Confirmed with the user: a tele-consultation booking gets a real video-call room generated and
attached, without touching its step list at all (`steps=FULL_FLOW`, unchanged). Revised mid-build
per the user's own explicit "soft-gate" call: the link is generated and persisted at booking time,
but deliberately **not shown** in the immediate booking-confirmation message — it's surfaced later,
close to the actual slot, via the reminder message instead, so a patient can't casually share or
join a "live" room hours or days early.

**How it was built** — a new `TypeFlow.on_booking_confirmed` hook (`flows/booking/types/base.py`):
an optional async `(appointment_id, hospital_id, patient_id, connector) -> dict | None` callable
run right after `connector.create_booking()` succeeds. `None` (the default) leaves every other
type's notification untouched.
- `db/orm_models.py` / `db/schema.sql` / `db/migrations/versions/0004_appointment_video_link.py` /
  `db/init_db.py` — new `appointments.video_link` column (nullable, `TEXT`), non-tele rows always
  `NULL`.
- `db/repositories/appointments.py` — new `set_appointment_video_link(hospital_id, appointment_id,
  video_link)`; existing appointment-read query/`db/models.py`'s `Appointment` now carry
  `video_link` through.
- `connectors/base.py` / `connectors/tier1.py` — `set_appointment_video_link` added to the
  `Connector` protocol and `Tier1Connector` implementation.
- `flows/booking/types/tele_consultation.py` — `_on_tele_booking_confirmed` (the
  `on_booking_confirmed` hook): builds a Jitsi Meet URL (`https://meet.jit.si/CareConnect-<token>`)
  with a fresh `secrets.token_urlsafe(24)` CSPRNG token per booking (never derived from appointment
  id/timestamp/patient info, so it can't be guessed or enumerated — Jitsi has no auth, the room
  name itself is the access control), persists it via `set_appointment_video_link`, and returns
  `{"video_link": ...}`. `FLOW = TypeFlow(type_id="tele", steps=FULL_FLOW,
  on_booking_confirmed=_on_tele_booking_confirmed)`.
- `flows/booking/book.py` — `_create_booking_and_notify` calls `flow.on_booking_confirmed(...)`
  right after `create_appointment()` succeeds, before building the confirmation summary; per the
  soft-gate revision, the returned dict is no longer consulted here (the confirmation text is
  identical to every other type).
- `flows/booking/reschedule.py` — rescheduling creates a genuinely new appointment row that
  inherits the old row's `appointment_type_id` but not its `video_link` (a room is tied to a
  specific slot, not carried across a date/time change), so the reschedule success path
  re-resolves `get_type_flow(new_appointment.appointment_type_id)` and re-runs
  `on_booking_confirmed` for the new row — otherwise a rescheduled tele-consultation's reminder
  would have no link.
- `reminders/scheduler.py` — the reminder builder appends the video link line only when
  `appointment_type_id == "tele"` and `video_link` is set (handles the gap between booking and the
  hook actually persisting it, and any pre-existing row from before this migration).
- `portal/routes/bookings.py` — surfaces `video_link` in the admin/portal booking payload (`None`
  for every non-tele row).
- Tests: `tests/test_booking_flow.py`'s `test_tele_consultation_booking_generates_and_stores_a_video_link`,
  `test_tele_consultation_video_link_token_is_not_predictable`,
  `test_non_tele_types_get_no_video_link_in_their_confirmation`,
  `test_rescheduling_a_tele_consultation_generates_a_fresh_video_link`; `tests/test_reminders.py`'s
  `test_tele_appointment_reminder_includes_video_link`,
  `test_non_tele_appointment_reminder_has_no_video_link`,
  `test_tele_appointment_with_no_video_link_yet_gets_plain_reminder`.
- Full backend suite passing except the same pre-existing, unrelated reception-handoff failures.

### Step 4 — Daycare (`daycare.py`) — ✅ DONE

Confirmed with the user directly (a short design discussion, not assumed): the original Phase-1
placeholder plan ("replace time-slot with a date-range step") was revised once the user raised that
some daycare stays are only a few hours, not a multi-day range. Final shape: the existing
department→doctor→date→time-slot pickers are kept completely unchanged (a daycare patient still
needs a real arrival slot), and exactly ONE new step is inserted after time-slot and before
confirmation — picking a stay-length option from a **hospital-configurable** list (not a fixed
enum — confirmed with the user: a same-day 6-hour stay and a 2-night admission both need to be
expressible, and hospitals price/label these differently).

**How it was built**:
- `flows/booking/state.py` — new `STATE_AWAITING_DAYCARE_DURATION` state; new
  `CHANGE_DURATION`/`_CHANGE_TARGETS` entry so the confirmation screen's "what would you like to
  change?" menu can jump straight back to it.
- `flows/booking/types/base.py` — new `TypeFlow.next_step(current) -> str` method (walks `steps`,
  falls back to `STATE_AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` past the end or for an unrecognized state) — the one
  shared transition point (time-slot completion, `book.py`) that previously hardcoded its next
  state directly now calls this, so daycare can insert an extra step there with no
  `if appointment_type_id == "daycare"` branch in shared code. `OnBookingConfirmedHook` extended to
  also receive the live booking `context` (tele's hook ignores it; daycare's needs
  `context["daycare_duration_hours"]`).
- `flows/booking/types/daycare.py` — its own `steps` tuple (`FULL_FLOW` with
  `STATE_AWAITING_DAYCARE_DURATION` inserted before confirmation, kept local rather than in
  `base.py` since no other type reuses it), `_send_daycare_duration_menu` +
  `_handle_awaiting_daycare_duration` (the new state's own handler, registered in
  `dispatch.py`'s `_HANDLERS`), and `_on_daycare_duration_confirmed` (the `on_booking_confirmed`
  hook) which persists the chosen duration via `connector.set_appointment_duration`.
- `db/repositories/daycare_duration_options.py` (new) + `daycare_duration_options` table
  (migration `0008`) — hospital-configurable list (`get_daycare_duration_options` for the active
  subset the WhatsApp flow shows; `get_all_daycare_duration_options_for_hospital` plus
  create/update/toggle/delete for the portal), seeded with 3 defaults ("4-6 hours", "Full day",
  "Overnight (1 night)") per hospital by `db/init_db.py`'s `_backfill_daycare_duration_options`.
  Unlike `appointment_types` (a closed, id-keyed catalog), this is a genuinely open one — a
  hospital can add/relabel/remove its own options, so the backfill only seeds hospitals with zero
  existing rows rather than gating per-row.
- `appointments.duration_hours` (migration `0008`, alongside the new table) — the chosen option's
  `hours`, persisted onto the booking itself so it survives the option later being relabeled or
  deactivated. `db/repositories/appointments.py`'s `create_appointment()` gained an optional
  `duration_hours` param (used only by reschedule's carry-forward below — a fresh booking always
  starts NULL and gets set via the hook after creation, same as tele's `video_link`); new
  `set_appointment_duration(hospital_id, appointment_id, duration_hours)`. `db/models.py`'s
  `Appointment` dataclass and the ORM `AppointmentRow` both carry the new column through.
- `connectors/base.py` / `connectors/tier1.py` — `get_daycare_duration_options` and
  `set_appointment_duration` added to the `Connector` protocol.
- Reschedule handling: unlike tele's video link (deliberately regenerated fresh per slot, since the
  room is tied to a specific booking), daycare's duration isn't slot-specific and the reschedule
  flow never re-asks it. `connectors/tier1.py`'s `reschedule_booking()` carries the ORIGINAL
  appointment's `duration_hours` onto the new row at creation time (same pattern as
  `appointment_type_id`), and `_on_daycare_duration_confirmed` is a no-op when
  `context["daycare_duration_hours"]` is absent (the reschedule call site's context never has it) —
  so the hook only ever acts on a genuinely fresh booking.
- `flows/booking/messages.py` — `_send_confirmation` appends a `⏱ Duration:` line when
  `context["daycare_duration_label"]` is set (shown immediately, unlike tele's link — there's no
  "don't reveal early" concern for a duration choice); `_resend_menu_for_state` and
  `_send_change_selection_menu` both gained the new state/row (lazy-imported, same
  cycle-avoidance as `followup.py`'s case).
- `portal/routes/daycare_duration_options.py` (new) — full CRUD (list/create/update/toggle/delete),
  reusing the existing `manage_appointment_types` capability rather than adding a new one, since
  it's the same portal screen area. No frontend admin page yet — backend-only for this pass, same
  scope boundary Phase 2 has kept type-by-type; flagged here for a follow-up.
- `core/translations.py` — `select_daycare_duration` / `view_durations_button` /
  `daycare_durations_section_title` / `change_duration_option` / `confirm_daycare_duration_line`
  (en/hi).
- Tests: `tests/test_appointment_type_flows.py`'s updated `test_known_types_resolve_to_their_own_flow`
  (daycare's actual step tuple, not `FULL_FLOW`) and new `test_next_step`;
  `tests/test_booking_flow.py`'s `test_daycare_booking_asks_for_duration_and_stores_it`,
  `test_rescheduling_a_daycare_appointment_carries_the_same_duration_forward`, and the shared
  `_book_through_confirmation` helper updated to drive through the new step for every type that has
  it.
- Full backend suite passing (674 tests, no regressions).

### Step 5 — Diagnostic Test & Lab Test (`_diagnostic_shared.py`) — ✅ DONE

Built from a detailed business spec (test → variant → resource-linked date/time → prep
instructions folded into review → confirm). Confirmed with the user directly, overriding this
doc's own "one type at a time" pacing: Diagnostic Test and Lab Test are structurally identical
(same journey, same catalog/resource needs, differing only in which `diagnostic_tests.category`
they list) and the live WhatsApp menu already presents them as siblings under "Tests &
Diagnostics" — so both landed together, sharing one implementation, rather than as two separate
passes. Resource (machine/equipment) scheduling got full parity with the existing doctor-scheduling
stack (own weekly hours/breaks/leave, generated slots, portal management UI) — confirmed with the
user over a lighter "coarse daily capacity" alternative. Prescription-status tracking (spec'd but
not built) and real payment collection (no gateway exists in this codebase) were both explicitly
deferred out of scope for this pass.

**How it was built**:
- New tables (migration `0025`): `diagnostic_tests` (id, hospital_id, category
  `'diagnostic'|'lab'`, name, resource_id nullable, is_active, sort_order) + `diagnostic_test_variants`
  (test_id, label, price, preparation_instructions, is_active, sort_order) — every test has ≥1
  variant, price/prep always live on the variant, never the test, so there's no "sometimes on
  test, sometimes on variant" split downstream. `diagnostic_resources` (+ `diagnostic_resource_leave`
  / `diagnostic_resource_slots`) mirror `doctors`/`doctor_leave`/`doctor_slots` column-for-column,
  so `generate_slots_for_resource()` (`db/repositories/diagnostic_resources.py`) reuses
  `generate_slots_for_doctor()`'s algorithm directly. Seeded per hospital
  (`_backfill_diagnostic_tests`): 8 default diagnostic tests / 7 default lab tests, each with one
  "Standard" variant, `resource_id` NULL until a hospital links a real machine.
- `appointments.doctor_id` became nullable (a resource-bound booking has no doctor at all) — new
  `resource_id`/`diagnostic_test_id`/`diagnostic_test_variant_id` FKs plus
  `diagnostic_test_label`/`diagnostic_variant_label`/`diagnostic_price` snapshots (same
  denormalization convention as `patient_name`), a `CHECK (doctor_id IS NOT NULL OR resource_id IS
  NOT NULL)`, and a resource-scoped sibling of the doctor double-booking unique index
  (`ux_appointments_resource_slot_ordinal_booked`). `create_appointment()`
  (`db/repositories/appointments.py`) gained a parallel resource-keyed branch for the advisory
  lock/quota/booking-ordinal logic — additive, the existing doctor-keyed path is untouched. Only
  `resource_id` goes through `create_appointment()` itself (it participates in the locking); the
  rest (`diagnostic_test_id`/variant/labels/price) are set post-creation via
  `set_appointment_diagnostic_details()`, same pattern as daycare's `set_appointment_duration`.
- `flows/booking/types/_diagnostic_shared.py` (new) — the one shared implementation `diagnostic.py`
  and `lab.py` both point their `FLOW` at (`make_flow("diagnostic"|"lab")`); every handler derives
  which category to query from `context["appointment_type_id"]`, which already equals
  `diagnostic_tests.category`. New `STATE_AWAITING_DIAGNOSTIC_TEST`/`STATE_AWAITING_DIAGNOSTIC_VARIANT`
  states (`_STEPS` inserts both before `STATE_AWAITING_DATE`); `on_selected` hook bypasses the
  generic department/doctor entry logic entirely (same mechanism `followup.py` uses); a test with
  exactly one variant auto-skips the variant screen (same single-choice-auto-skip convention used
  elsewhere); `build_confirmation_summary`/`build_success_summary` produce the spec's own card text
  (no prescription-status line, per the scope decision above); `on_booking_confirmed` persists the
  chosen variant/price/labels.
- `flows/booking/book.py`/`messages.py`/`reschedule.py` — the shared date/time handlers
  (`_handle_awaiting_date`/`_handle_awaiting_time_slot`, `_send_date_menu`/`_send_time_menu`, and
  reschedule's own equivalents) all gained a small `context["resource_id"]` branch: when set, slot
  lookups go through `get_available_resource_slots` instead of `get_available_slots`; when unset
  (every other type), behavior is byte-identical to before. A resource-less diagnostic/lab test
  originally fell back to `_first_available_resource` (any doctor with open slots) — **removed in
  a later follow-up** (confirmed with the user directly: a lab/diagnostic booking must never
  silently attach to an unrelated doctor's calendar) — see the Step 5 follow-up entry below for
  the current "not available" treatment. `Connector`/`Tier1Connector.reschedule_booking()` carries
  `resource_id`/the diagnostic snapshot fields forward from the old appointment, same precedent as
  `duration_hours`.
- Portal: new `manage_diagnostic_resources` capability (`portal/capabilities.py`, hospital-tier
  only, same weight as `manage_doctors`) with a one-time backfill appending it onto already-
  backfilled hospitals' `admin_capabilities` (unlike `role_permissions`, that column is a
  materialized snapshot, not computed with a per-key fallback, so a newly-added capability needs
  its own backfill step). Test/variant catalog CRUD reuses `manage_appointment_types` (same
  screen area as daycare's own catalog). New `portal/routes/diagnostic_tests.py` (tests + variants
  CRUD) and `diagnostic_resources.py` (resource CRUD + slots/leave, mirroring `doctors.py`'s own
  routes). New `PAGE_DIAGNOSTIC_TESTS` in `portal/permissions.py` (off by default for
  receptionist/doctor — no backfill needed, `get_permission_matrix()` already falls back to the
  default per-page-key at read time). Frontend: new "Diagnostic Tests" nav item/page
  (`/portal/diagnostic-tests`) with a Tests column (`DiagnosticTestsManager.tsx`, category
  tabs + nested variant CRUD) and a Resources column (`DiagnosticResourcesManager.tsx` +
  `ResourceSlotManager.tsx`/`ResourceLeaveManager.tsx`, generalizing `DoctorSlotManager.tsx`'s shape).
- Tests: `tests/test_diagnostic_resources.py` (new) — resource CRUD/slot generation, multi-variant
  selection, resource double-booking rejection, reschedule carry-forward, resource-less fallback.
  `tests/test_appointment_type_flows.py`/`test_booking_flow.py` updated for diagnostic/lab's new
  step tuple and their own success-card wording.
- Full backend suite passing (801 tests, no regressions, real Postgres via testcontainers).
  Frontend: `tsc --noEmit` and `next build` both clean; not yet manually exercised in a running
  browser against a live backend.

### Step 5 follow-up — Lab Test splits off into its own basket flow — ✅ DONE

The user supplied a separate, more detailed business spec specifically for Lab Test (multi-test
basket, a collection-method choice with serviceability-gated home sample collection, an itemized
price review, a post-booking report lifecycle) and confirmed it should be built as given, with
proper reuse and without breaking Diagnostic Test's already-shipped single-item flow. Lab Test no
longer shares `_diagnostic_shared.py` with Diagnostic Test — `diagnostic.py` is untouched;
`flows/booking/types/lab.py` is now a real module with its own steps.

**How it was built**:
- New migration `0026`: `lab_service_areas` (hospital-configurable serviceable PIN codes, same
  open-catalog shape as `daycare_duration_options`), `appointment_lab_tests` (the basket — N rows
  per one `appointments` row, one per selected test+variant, snapshot columns same convention as
  `diagnostic_test_label`), new `appointments` columns `collection_method`/`collection_address`/
  `collection_pincode`/`home_collection_charge`/`lab_status` (all only ever set for a Lab Test
  booking — Diagnostic Test's existing singular `diagnostic_test_id`/variant/label/price columns
  are untouched, still meaning "the one item" for that type), and `hospital_settings.
  home_collection_charge` (same convention as `followup_fee`/`new_consultation_fee`).
- A Lab Test basket resolves to a single `resource_id` — the first basket item with one configured
  — reusing the entire resource-scheduling engine built for Diagnostic Test verbatim (no second
  scheduling engine). Resource resolution + date-menu advancement was factored out of
  `_diagnostic_shared.py`'s `_proceed_with_variant` into a shared `resolve_resource_and_advance_to_
  date()` helper, called by both Diagnostic Test's single-item path and Lab Test's basket path.

### Step 5 follow-up #2 — removed the any-doctor fallback entirely — ✅ DONE

Confirmed with the user directly: neither Diagnostic Test nor Lab Test should ever silently borrow
an unrelated doctor's calendar to find a bookable slot — a lab/diagnostic booking's availability
must reflect its OWN linked resource's real capacity, full stop. `resolve_resource_and_advance_to_
date()` (`_diagnostic_shared.py`) no longer calls `book.py`'s `_first_available_resource()` when a
test has no resource linked (or its linked resource has been deactivated/removed) — it now shows
the same "no slots available right now" message an unconfigured doctor (one with no working hours
set, hence zero generated slots) already produces elsewhere in this app, then returns to the main
menu. `_first_available_resource()` itself is untouched and still used by `book.py`'s own generic
`_proceed_with_appointment_type()` fallback branch (a safety net for a hypothetical future
custom hospital appointment type with no department step of its own — not reachable by any
built-in type today, all of which set their own `on_selected` hook).

**The real consequence**: every hospital's *seeded default* diagnostic/lab tests have no resource
linked out of the box, so this makes them genuinely unbookable until an admin creates a resource
in the portal and links it to each test — same as a freshly onboarded doctor with no hours set is
unbookable until someone configures their schedule. This is an intentional, discussed trade-off,
not an oversight.

Updated `tests/test_diagnostic_resources.py`'s `test_resource_less_test_falls_back_to_any_doctor_
with_open_slots` (renamed, now asserts the new "not available, no appointment created" behavior)
and added `test_deactivated_resource_also_shows_not_available`. `tests/test_booking_flow.py`'s
`_book_through_confirmation` helper and 3 more of its own diagnostic-specific tests now create and
link a resource before driving a booking through (a resource-less test can no longer reach date
selection at all). `tests/test_lab_test_basket.py`'s flow-level tests now link one shared resource
to every lab test via a new `_link_all_lab_tests_to_resource()` helper for the same reason. Full
backend suite passing (821 tests, no regressions).
- `lab.py`'s own states: `STATE_AWAITING_LAB_TEST` (repeatable — an "Add Another Test?"/"Done,
  Continue" loop after each add) → `STATE_AWAITING_LAB_TEST_VARIANT` (a genuinely new state, not a
  reuse of `STATE_AWAITING_DIAGNOSTIC_VARIANT` — that one assigns a single variant and proceeds
  straight to date; Lab Test's appends to a growing basket and loops) → `STATE_AWAITING_COLLECTION_
  METHOD` (visit vs. home, buttons) → for home: `STATE_AWAITING_COLLECTION_PINCODE` (serviceability
  check via `is_pincode_serviceable()`, with a "Visit Hospital/Lab instead" fallback rather than a
  dead end on a non-serviceable PIN) → `STATE_AWAITING_COLLECTION_ADDRESS` → the existing date/time
  steps. Confirmation card is itemized (each test+variant+price line, home-collection charge line,
  total) with a single fasting/preparation paragraph built from the union of non-blank
  `preparation_instructions` across the basket, omitted entirely when none of the selected tests
  need one.
- Report lifecycle rides on two existing mechanisms rather than a new one: staff advance
  `booked → sample_collected → processing` one step at a time via a new `/api/portal/bookings/
  {id}/lab-status` route (never lets staff set `report_ready` directly); uploading a `lab_report`
  document against the appointment (`portal/routes/documents.py` — `patient_documents.
  appointment_id` already existed) automatically sets `report_ready` and sends a WhatsApp
  notification synchronously in that same route, reusing the exact `WhatsAppClient(...)` +
  `send_text()` pattern already used a few lines below for "Send to WhatsApp" — no cron job, since
  the staff upload click IS the trigger.
- `Tier1Connector.reschedule_booking()` carries `collection_method`/`address`/`pincode`/
  `home_collection_charge` forward the same way as `duration_hours`/the diagnostic snapshot fields;
  the basket itself (a child table) is copied via a new `copy_lab_basket()`. `lab_status`
  deliberately resets to `'booked'` on the new row rather than carrying forward as-is — the new
  slot's own report lifecycle starts fresh.
- Discount/package pricing: explicitly out of scope, same "don't build unrequested infrastructure"
  call already made for payment gateway/prescription-status.
- Tests: new `tests/test_lab_test_basket.py` — multi-test basket happy path, already-added-test
  exclusion, fasting paragraph shown/omitted correctly, serviceable/non-serviceable home collection
  (with the visit fallback), reschedule carrying the basket+collection details forward,
  `lab_service_areas` CRUD, the lab-status advance endpoint's forward-only guard, and the
  document-upload → report-ready → WhatsApp-notification trigger (mocked send). Updated
  `test_appointment_type_flows.py`/`test_booking_flow.py`'s shared `_book_through_confirmation`
  helper for Lab Test's now-distinct step shape — Diagnostic Test's own tests
  (`test_diagnostic_resources.py`) are untouched and still pass.
- Full backend suite passing (819 tests, no regressions, real Postgres via testcontainers).
  Frontend: `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, and `next build` all clean (new
  `LabServiceAreasManager.tsx` on the Settings page, a "Lab Status" column + advance action on the
  Appointments page, a `home_collection_charge` field on Settings); not yet manually exercised in a
  running browser against a live backend.

### Step 6+ — remaining types (not started, one at a time, each awaiting confirmation first)

- `second_opinion.py`: an optional document-upload step before confirmation.

Not implemented yet — listed only so the Phase-1 file layout is judged against where the
remaining Phase 2 work will land; only started once the user confirms it.

## Files touched (Phase 1)

- `backend/flows/booking/types/base.py` (new), `registry.py` (new), and one small module per
  type (`new_consultation.py`, `followup.py`, `tele_consultation.py`, `second_opinion.py`,
  `daycare.py`, `diagnostic.py`, `lab.py`) (new).
- `backend/flows/booking/book.py` — replace hardcoded next/prev-state transitions with
  `registry.get_type_flow(...)` lookups at the handful of transition points listed above; no
  handler body logic changes.
- `backend/flows/booking/messages.py` — change-selection menu built from `flow.steps`.
- `backend/flows/booking/state.py` — no new states; possibly remove the now-redundant static
  `_CHANGE_TARGETS` dict if fully replaced by `flow.prev_step`.

## Verification

- Existing tests must keep passing unchanged for all types except diagnostic/lab:
  `tests/test_booking_flow.py`, `test_booking_back_navigation.py`, `test_flows.py`.
- Update/add tests asserting diagnostic and lab bookings never see a department or doctor prompt
  and go straight from appointment-type selection to date selection (and that back-navigation
  from date returns to appointment-type selection, not doctor).
- Add a registry unit test: unknown/custom `appointment_type_id` falls back to `FULL_FLOW`.
- Manual: book one of each of the 7 types end-to-end via the dev webhook, confirming
  diagnostic/lab skip department+doctor and every other type's flow is pixel-identical to today.

## Daycare/Procedure rebuild — ✅ DONE (backend), portal admin UI still pending

The old duration-picker flow (`daycare.py`, `daycare_duration_options` table,
`appointments.duration_hours`) is deleted entirely and replaced with a real business spec:
procedure catalog (category + INSTANT_BOOKING/APPROVAL_REQUIRED booking mode + duration +
estimated price range), hospital-configured pre-procedure instructions, a multi-resource-
constraint availability engine (bed/chair + equipment + staff pools, each with its own generated
calendar cloned from `diagnostic_resources`), and a hospital-approval workflow with proactive
WhatsApp notifications + "Request Reschedule". `type_id` stays `"daycare"` — only the flow behind
it changed, no appointment_types/portal-filter/label churn.

- **Schema** (migration `0028_procedure_booking.py`): `procedures`,
  `procedure_required_resource_types`, `procedure_instructions`, `procedure_resources` (+ leave/
  slots, mirroring `diagnostic_resources`), `appointment_procedure_resources` (N resources per
  booking, same shape as `appointment_lab_tests`); `appointments` gains `procedure_id` + a
  separate nullable `procedure_status` sub-status (REQUESTED/UNDER_REVIEW/APPROVED/REJECTED/
  CONFIRMED/COMPLETED/CANCELLED, same convention as `lab_status`) + price snapshots + an optional
  order reference + a pending reschedule-request slot. `scheduled_at` stays NOT NULL — a
  REQUESTED/APPROVED row stamps it with the request's own creation time as a placeholder, never
  displayed as real until CONFIRMED.
- **Availability engine** (`db/repositories/procedure_slots.py`, genuinely new — nothing like it
  existed before): a candidate slot is valid only if EVERY required resource pool has a resource
  covering the procedure's full duration on its own generated grid, checked at booking time under
  the same `pg_advisory_xact_lock` discipline `create_appointment()` uses for its own single-
  resource case.
- **Flow** (`flows/booking/types/procedure.py`, new): Step 1 picks a procedure instead of a
  department; INSTANT_BOOKING reuses the shared `STATE_AWAITING_DATE`/`TIME_SLOT`/`CONFIRMATION`
  steps as-is (`book.py`'s `_get_slots`/`_send_date_menu`/`_send_time_menu` gained a third
  `procedure_id` branch alongside `doctor_id`/`resource_id`); APPROVAL_REQUIRED detours through its
  own pre-send review screen and creates a REQUESTED row with no slot yet. A repicked procedure
  with an open request resumes it (approved ones skip straight to date/time,
  `context["_procedure_appointment_id"]` tells `_create_booking_and_notify` to update that row in
  place via `confirm_procedure_appointment()` instead of creating a second one) rather than
  creating a duplicate. "Request Reschedule" is a deliberately separate mini-flow, not a retrofit
  of `reschedule.py`'s generic handlers — it only ever writes the desired slot, a portal action
  moves `scheduled_at` for real.
- **Portal**: `portal/routes/procedures.py` (new, catalog + resource-pool CRUD, gated by a new
  `manage_procedures` capability) and new approve/reject/advance-status/reschedule-request routes
  on `portal/routes/bookings.py`, all following the existing `portal_advance_lab_status`/
  `portal_mark_attendance` guarded-transition shape + best-effort WhatsApp notify pattern.
- **Not built this pass** (scoped down for time, backend/API is complete either way): the portal
  admin UI itself (`ProcedureManager`/`ProcedureResourcesManager`/`ProcedureApprovalQueue`
  components + a `/portal/procedures` page) — the routes exist and are tested, but there's no
  frontend screen yet to configure procedures/resources or work the approval queue visually. An
  optional free-text "linked order" WhatsApp prompt was also left out (the column exists,
  portal-set only for now).
- Full backend suite green (851 tests — 838 prior + 13 new in `test_procedure_flows.py`, real
  Postgres via testcontainers), covering instant booking, approval request/approve/reject/resume,
  multi-resource availability (including a duration spanning multiple grid sub-slots), and Request
  Reschedule. Frontend: `tsc --noEmit` and `next build` both clean; not yet manually exercised in a
  running browser (there's no portal UI yet to exercise beyond the WhatsApp flow itself).
